Hexpawn Game For The Vectrex

Way back in the mid-1970s my father came home with a KIM-1 'microcomputer' board.
One of my favorite games to play was KIM Hexpawn which was written by Robert C. Leedom.
This version of Hexpawn was mainly inspired by his work.

Vexpawn is based around chess rules but is played only with pawns on a 3x3 board.
It's human versus Vectrex and the player always starts first.
A winner is declared if they reach the opponent's side first, or gobble up all of opponent's pawns.
At first the Vectrex will be quite dumb in determining counter moves.
However, over time the Vectrex 'learns' and endeavors to make better moves.
Eventually the Vectrex cannot be beaten (in theory anyway).
The intro screen gives the player two choices: (1) Fresh Start (2) Keep Learning.

After each game the player is returned to the intro screen and can choose:

(1) Fresh Start - Vectrex forgets all that it has learned

(2) Keep Learning - The Vectrex keeps learned data from the previous games

Note:

I played the game many times over to test it but if Vectrex goes blank it means it can't find a counter-move.
If I find any issues I'll try to find time to fix them.
